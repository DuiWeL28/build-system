# heads ChangeLog

## 0.2
### 27 March 2017

Second stable release. More sophisticated and user-friendly, with some
helpful messages and generally a nicer interface. The software list has
been revised. Tor Browser now runs using the system-wide Tor instance
instead of starting its own. Mozilla relaxed their redistribution policy
and Thunderbird is back instead of Icedove. Sup is compiled on boot-time,
musl-libc is now included in the system, and general improvements have
been made with the firewall (iptables) setup.


## 0.1
### 10 March 2017

First stable release. Since this release, heads is now based on Devuan
Ascii, which allows us easier use of OverlayFS - thus avoiding the need
to patch the kernel with aufs4. Using Linux 4.4.52, in the same manner:
patched with Grsecurity and deblobbed with linux-libre.


## 0.0
### 28 February 2017

Initial public release. An unstable version to preview heads and start
looking on how it behaves and performs in real-world situations. Only a
64-bit version is released. Using Linux 4.4.45 patched with Grsecurity,
aufs4 and afterwards deblobbed with linux-libre. Based on Devuan Jessie.
