\subsection{heads' kernel}
\paragraph \\
The kernel heads uses is a non-standard one as some might have expected.
It's a specific version, patched with grsecurity and uses a configuration
specifically tailored for heads. The sources (and the git log) can be
found here: \url{https://git.devuan.org/heads/linux-heads}).

\paragraph \\
Luckily, as heads is using git\footnotemark for version control,
it's not needed to have separate patches stored somewhere as they
are now easily available from the git log. The deblobbing scripts
from linux-libre\footnotemark, however, are downloaded from
their website.

\paragraph \\
Before I mentioned a function called \textbf{build\_kernel\_arch}.
It is somewhat like a function pointer and the function gets called
depending on what architecture is declared for the current build. This
function will clone the kernel git repo (or pull the latest master if it
is already there), compile it, and install it along with the modules in
the heads bootstrap directory. It is a function already declared in
libdevuansdk, but here we override it since we are building a custom
kernel.
