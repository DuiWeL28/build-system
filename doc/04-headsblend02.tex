\subsection{From start to finish}
\paragraph \\
The basic workflow of functions to bootstrap an entire system is the
following (the functions whose names don't start with "blend" are either
parts of live-sdk or libdevuansdk):
\begin{verbatim}
bootstrap_complete_base
blend_preinst
iso_prepare_strap
build_kernel_${arch}
iso_setup_isolinux
iso_write_isolinux_cfg
blend_postinst
iso_squash_strap
iso_xorriso_build
\end{verbatim}

I will not cover the foreign functions here, only the blend-specific.

\paragraph \\
Currently in \emph{blend\_preinst} there is only the creation of the user
"luther", so that's that.

\paragraph \\
\emph{build\_kernel\_arch} is architecture specific (i386/amd64) and will be
explained in the kernel chapter.

\paragraph \\
In \emph{blend\_postinst} there is more magic happening. Here we compile and
install packages from source to the system, clone the \emph{rootfs overlay}
and do the final fixes and hacks. The rootfs overlay is also a chapter of its
own.
