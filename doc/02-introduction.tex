\section{Introduction}
\paragraph \\
heads is a libre GNU/Linux distribution loosely based around the
concepts of the Tails\footnotemark  GNU/Linux distribution. heads
strives to be a minimal live distribution for activists, journalists,
geeks, and privacy-aware people in general. This is mainly achieved by
utilizing the Tor\footnotemark  network to the maximum. It is one of
the key features: routing \textbf{all} network traffic in heads through
the Tor network. This enables one to stay as anonymous as possible when
using the Internet.

\paragraph \\
Though important, not only anonymity is the only thing needed. Security
is an important aspect as well. heads tries to achieve it by using a
grsecurity\footnotemark-patched kernel, and offering only libre
software. While libre software can still be malicious, chances are, it
is not. At least less possible than proprietary software which is much
more difficult to audit (since one can not read its code).

\paragraph \\
All of these quirks and features will be mentioned further in the
document.
