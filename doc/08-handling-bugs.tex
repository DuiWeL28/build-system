Yes, a bunch of bugs.\\

\subsection{The bugtracker}
\paragraph \\
heads doesn't have the usual Bugzilla bugtracker or similar, it rather utilizes
GitLab issues to track bugs, feature requests and such. You can find the link
above.

\subsubsection{Reporting bugs}
\paragraph \\
To report bugs, you should be registered at \url{https://github.com}.
Although, if you are a heads developer, my guess is you already are registered.
To report a bug, you simply open a new issue in the bugtracker repository. Keep
in mind it's always a good idea to search through existing bugs before reporting
anything. It will make me hate you a little bit less\footnotemark.
Make sure to write your bug report as descriptive as you can, and if applicable,
tag it accordingly. Take look at the existing issues as a guideline.

\subsubsection{Fixing bugs}
\paragraph \\
To fix bugs, search through the existing issues and find out how to resolve
them. Simple as that. Once you think you have a bugfix, report it on the issue
and it will be reviewed.
