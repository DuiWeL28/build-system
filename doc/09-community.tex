\section{Talking heads}
\paragraph \\
Discussion around and about heads can be done on IRC\footnotemark and the
mailing list\footnotemark. These are the prefered
way of communication about all kinds of topics. IRC is a good place to ask if
you are not sure if you should report a bug or not - for example. The mailing
list is a good place to talk about anything. But again, if it's a bug, just
report it on the bugtracker.

So that's it. I hope this has helped you at least somehow. If you feel like
